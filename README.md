Purpose of this software:

Find upstream intergenic regions consisting of regulatory elements like promotors and aligning them with respective orthologs in Psudomonas species for your query gene which can then be visualized with Clustalx to perform a complete multiple seqeunce alignment to find conserved intergenic regions amongst orthologs and query gene/genes.
